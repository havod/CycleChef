## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0B7D6), chosen for its calming and nurturing feel, referencing the themes of women's health and cyclical changes.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), offering a clean and neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the app's content. This hue is similar to the primary color, but is desaturated and light to provide visual balance.
- Accent color: Pale rose (#E0B0B3), selected for its warmth and to complement the lavender and gray tones. It's slightly desaturated and adjusted in brightness to stand out without being overwhelming.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif with an elegant feel, best suited for headlines or small amounts of text; body font: 'PT Sans' to ensure readability
- Use minimalist, line-based icons related to food, health, and the menstrual cycle. Ensure consistency and clarity in icon design.
- Employ a clean, intuitive layout with clear section divisions and easy navigation. Use a grid system to maintain consistency across different screen sizes.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as smooth transitions and loading indicators, to enhance user experience without being distracting.
